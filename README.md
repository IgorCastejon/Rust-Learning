# Rust-Learning

Some of the code that I've written while learning Rust. Because of that, it's not optimized (String, std HashMap/Hashset, unnecessary copies, and so on) and not a testament of my programming skills or current Rust expertise.

While learning, I took my time to also practice TDD (test-driven development), so there are a lot of tests.

I did the following code katas:
* http://codekata.com/kata/kata19-word-chains/
* https://kata-log.rocks/christmas-lights-kata
* https://kata-log.rocks/gossiping-bus-drivers-kata

I started implementing an URL shortener web service using [Axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum), but I still need to take some time to finish it.
